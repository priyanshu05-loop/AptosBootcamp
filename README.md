# 🪙 TokenVault Smart Contract

## 📜 Description
**TokenVault** is a simple Move-based Aptos smart contract that allows users to securely deposit and withdraw Aptos tokens (`AptosCoin`) into their personal on-chain vault.  
Each user owns a dedicated vault tied to their account address, ensuring complete control over their stored funds.  

The contract is lightweight with only **two core functions**:
- `deposit_tokens` → Add Aptos tokens to your vault.
- `withdraw_tokens` → Withdraw a specific amount of tokens from your vault back to your wallet.

## 🎯 Vision
Our vision is to provide a **secure, minimal, and efficient** on-chain vault system for Aptos token holders.  
We aim to make token storage and retrieval seamless while preserving transparency and ownership.  
This project serves as a foundation for more advanced token management systems on Aptos.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- **Multi-token support** → Extend vaults to store any fungible token type, not just `AptosCoin`.
- **Interest-bearing vaults** → Implement staking logic so deposits can earn rewards over time.
- **Access control** → Add delegated access so trusted addresses can manage vault funds.
- **Vault analytics** → Provide deposit/withdraw history with transaction metadata.
- **Integration with DApps** → Connect vaults to lending, trading, or gaming platforms.
